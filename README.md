# pic!

A photo manager app for iOS written in swift. 


The idea is to take many photos from the user's photo album and place them side by side in comparison, where the user can narrow down to a single photo to share. 
The user selects which photos to compare from a drop down multiple selection menu (found on cocopods).
The photos are then navigated by gestures:


-swipe right or left to move to the next photo

-swipe up to delete the photo from the selected photos library

-rotate phone into landscape mode to see photos placed side by side (same gestures apply)

-in portrait mode, drag swipe from far right-left to see deleted photos (or click upper right arrow)


Deleted photos can be deleted from the users photo library. To do so, select photos from deleted photos library, press the trashcan and accept permissions.

When the user has narrowed down to the final photo the user can share the photo to Facebook, Twitter, mail or messenger. 

Enjoy!
